# The-Stewart-Platform-Puppeteer
This repository houses the code for The Stewart Platform Puppeteer, a project of mine that I will be submitting in the Georgia Student Technology Competition. It was previously submitted in the Cobb Regional Technology Competition- earning 1st place in robotics for 11th-12th grade.

The Stewart Platform Puppeteer is a 6 Degree of Freedom machine controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. Input is received through 3 joysticks and the Stewart Platform is moved by 6 microservos. The Stewart Platform is used to control a marionette puppet, hence the name Stewart Platform Puppeteer, but it, like any other Stewart Platform, has many applications that it is not currently being used for.

Disclaimer: this code was adapted based off of other open-source codes and is calibrated for my specific robot. The basic concepts however, like the kinematics used to determine the desired position, are applicable across many platforms.

Note: I encourage those looking at this code to also read the comments- they are there to help explain the code and should be used. 

Thanks for reading!
